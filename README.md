- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoachimKvamme

- I'm a Norwegian, and my formal education is in philosophy, and I have previously worked as a journalist. Right now I'm trying to get into coding with python, after introducing myself to programming via Xcode (Swift). Being new to the world of computer science and coding, I'm not at this point sure what GitHub is, but I'm here to learn. 
-  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... html, CSS, JavaScript and Python.
- Python! (and GitHub!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
